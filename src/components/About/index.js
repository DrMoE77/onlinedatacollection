                        I am a Pharmacist, training to be a lawyer. I am currently working on a Medication reminder app and data science collection for my research with UTS-ASU. The most recent work for me was at Priceline Wentworth Point. up until March 2022. In 2019 I went overseas for a while with my family and when I returned, I was studying full-time for my Master of Pharmaceutical Medicine and doing some locum work. 
I am a pharmacist. I have completed five University degrees and I am currently completing my PhD. I am completing my full-stack development course and will be moving on to a data science course. I wanted to learn code so I can apply my knowledge and ideas in the areas of Medicine and Pharmacy, innovative science and technology and even in the Law.

In my PhD I am conducting research that involves both the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) and Arizona State University (ASU). </p>
